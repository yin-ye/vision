# Vision-Based Machine Learning Projects

In these projects, I explore **vision-based machine learning** techniques to build intelligent systems that can understand and interpret visual data. The projects cover a wide range of applications, including **gesture control**, **supervised and unsupervised classification**, **blob detection**, and **clustering**.

## üöÄ Key Highlights

- **Gesture Control**: 
  - Developed models that utilize **machine learning** to recognize hand gestures and map them to specific actions.
  - Techniques used: **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for real-time gesture recognition, and **image processing** for hand tracking.
  
- **Supervised Classification**:
  - Implemented vision-based classification systems where models are trained on labeled datasets.
  - Use cases include identifying objects, detecting specific patterns, and categorizing images using popular algorithms such as **SVM**, **KNN**, and **Random Forest**.

- **Unsupervised Classification & Clustering**:
  - Explored unsupervised learning techniques for image classification without labeled data.
  - Techniques like **K-Means Clustering** and **Hierarchical Clustering** were applied for grouping similar images or regions.
  
- **Blob Detection**:
  - Focused on identifying distinct objects (or "blobs") in images through **blob detection** techniques.
  - Applications include object tracking and image segmentation using methods like **Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)**, **Difference of Gaussians (DoG)**, and **SimpleBlobDetector**.

## üß† Technologies & Tools

- **OpenCV**: For image processing and computer vision tasks.
- **TensorFlow** / **Keras**: To build and train machine learning models.
- **scikit-learn**: For classification and clustering algorithms.
- **Python**: Programming language of choice for all implementations.

## üìä Project Objectives

- Build intuitive, gesture-controlled systems for user interaction.
- Implement robust supervised and unsupervised classification algorithms for various image recognition tasks.
- Explore blob detection techniques to isolate meaningful objects in visual data.
- Use clustering techniques to find patterns in unlabeled image data.
